### Hi there, I'm Pablo! 👋

I'm a **Software Developer** from Brazil, passionate about creating effective and inclusive web experiences. I don't just write code; I care about the entire product lifecycle, from **UI/UX prototyping in Figma** to **Agile management** and final delivery.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **SELI (Inclusive Learning Platform)**
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my skills in **JavaScript & React**
- 🎨 I believe that **Design + Logic** = Great Products.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm building an asynchronous RPG platform in my free time!
